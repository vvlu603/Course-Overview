    "A loop is a control structure that allows statements to be executed multiple times.  The uses for loops in data science are endless.  We may want to perform an operation on every entry in a data table.  We may want to process a user request, then prepare for the next request to come in.  We may want to keep guessing at model coefficents that fit a data set until the accuracy we get is good enough.  In fact, almost all interesting algorithms we will implement involve loops in some way. Python provides two main ways to create loops."
